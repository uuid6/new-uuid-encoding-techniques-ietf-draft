                   Alternate UUID Encoding Techniques
              draft-davis-uuidrev-alternate-uuid-encoding

Abstract

   This document presents new Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
   encoding techniques which facilitate greater efficiency in storage or
   transport versus the unnecessarily verbose text representation from
   [RFC9562].

   This document updates [RFC9562] and provides alternate encoding
   techniques which perform better on the wire, in a database, or
   withing various other application logics.

1.  Introduction

   The original "hex and dash", 8-4-4-4-12, format of UUIDs defined by
   [RFC9562] represents a 128 bit UUID value as a 288 bit value.  While
   this may be great for human readability; the only available UUID text
   representation suffers poorly for storage, transmission and
   application parsing.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Abbreviations

   The following abbreviations are used in this document:

   UUID          Universally Unique Identifier [RFC9562]

   URN           Uniform Resource Name [RFC8141]

3.  Alternate Encodings

   The existing UUID hex and dash format of 8-4-4-4-12 is retained for
   both backwards compatibility and human readability.  This format MUST
   be implemented for all UUIDs.

   Where required, UUIDs defined by this specification and [RFC9562] MAY
   be encoded utilizing new techniques such as, but not limited to,
   Base32, Base36, or Base64.  Applications MAY also utilize other
   encoding techniques such as modulo division or alternate alphabets
   such as Crockford's base32.  When selecting an alternate encoding
   implementations SHOULD take into consideration items such as:
   uppercase/lowercase/mixed character encoding for application
   sortability, special character inclusions or omissions, and the
   exclusion of key letters like "I", "L", "O", and "U" which may impact
   sortability of UUID values and collision resistance provided by all
   UUIDs.

   When utilizing alternate encoding techniques with other applications;
   the encoded UUID MAY be prefixed with extended "urn:uuid:" to signal
   that the value therein is that of a UUID.

   The conversion from UUID to a new encoding technique SHOULD be done
   utilizing the underlying integer or binary value for a given UUID
   versus converting the hex representation.  Two examples for UUIDv4
   encoded as base-32 and base-36 are included below.

   urn:uuid:73e94fe0-e951-4153-aaf3-50e4e6089d9d:128:base16hd
   urn:uuid:3JT57U1QAH859QLSQGSJJ0H7CT:128:base32
   urn:uuid:6V1GDX0NNGFV95EFF5TPJ0TR1:128:base36

                   Figure 1: Alternate Encoding Examples

   For information on converting a UUID into Base 16, Base 32 or Base 64
   refer to [RFC4648].

   Furthermore, when utilizing alternate encoding techniques along with
   Extended UUID URN namespaces; remember that disallowed characters
   MUST be percent-encoded as per [RFC8141].

4.  IANA Considerations

   If Adopted, this document SHOULD be listed in
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.
